# Scorebot Scoreboard Service

This is a new service (client) for Scorebot. Part of the Scorebot software collection.

The new scoreboard is built in Golang and allows for advanced display of the Scoreboard with a 75% reduction in traffic and loadtimes.

Websockets are used to facilitate communication between the host and scoreboard. The Golang program functions as a webserver and a "differ" to detect changes in the game state.

This software functions *seperate* from scorebot and can run on a seperate server if required.

More info to come soon! (Still developing lol).
